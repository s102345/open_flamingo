You'll be provided with two in-context examples containing the <IMG> token, supplementary details, and reference captions. Subsequently, you should interpret the <IMG> input along with the additional details and produce an output. Your prompt's effectiveness will be evaluated using the CIDEr metric, which gauges the resemblance between candidate captions and reference captions. Consequently, if your output captions achieve a higher score, it suggests that the image has been aptly described.",
